## Theme

I am all in on Catppuccin Latte, a light theme for all my apps that's beautiful and easy on the eyes.

Light themes translate well to print and work better with white-background images.

## Font

I use Hack, a typeface designed for source code, specifically a Nerd Font variant that includes icons for terminal applications.

## Terminal

My terminal of choice is Ghostty - fast, feature-rich, cross-platform with native UI and GPU acceleration.

## Programming language runtimes

For programming language runtimes, I use mise to manage installations.

Exceptions are Go (default toolchain works great) and Python (mostly using uv).

My approach is installing LTS versions globally with per-project overrides.

## Communication

I use Beeper as a unified chat app. I highly recommend it.

I also use the native Slack app, because it is my main work communication tool.

## Alt + Tab

I really like Windows' Alt+Tab feature for switching between applications.
On Mac, I used `AltTab`, and on Ubuntu this functionality is built-in.

## Application launcher

A single key to search and launch applications is essential.

On Ubuntu I use the built-in Super key search, though I would switch in a second if Raycast (which I used on Mac) was ported.

## Browser

I use Firefox as my main browser, occasionally switching to Chrome for development and testing.

## Containers

Docker is still my go-to tool for containerization.

I also use `lazydocker` for an enhanced CLI experience.

On Mac, I really liked OrbStack.

## Keybindings

I use VIM keybindings wherever possible - they are efficient and portable across applications.
