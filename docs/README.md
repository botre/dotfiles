## Theme

I am all in on Catppuccin Latte, which is a light theme for all the apps I use.

It's a beautiful theme that's easy on the eyes.

One advantage of using a light theme is that it translates well to print.

Another advantage is that many images have white backgrounds, making them easier to view in a light theme.

## Font

I use Hack, a typeface designed for source code, specifically a Nerd Font variant that includes icons for terminal applications.

## Terminal

For my terminal I am currently using Ghostty, a fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration.

In the past I have used Alacritty, Kitty, and iTerm2.

## Programming language runtimes

I use `mise` to manage installations of programming language runtimes and other tools for local development.

Two notable exceptions are Go (which manages this itself) and Python (for which I currently mostly use `uv`).

My current default is to install the LTS of the tool/runtime globally, and override on a per-project basis.

In the past I have used `asdf` for this.

## Beeper

I use Beeper which aggregates all my chat apps, I highly recommend it.
