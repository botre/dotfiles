## Theme

I am all in on Catppuccin Latte, a light theme for all my apps that's beautiful and easy on the eyes.

Light themes translate well to print and work better with white-background images.

## Font

I use Hack, a typeface designed for source code, specifically a Nerd Font variant that includes icons for terminal applications.

## Terminal

My terminal of choice is Ghostty - fast, feature-rich, cross-platform with native UI and GPU acceleration.

## Programming language runtimes

For programming language runtimes, I use mise to manage installations.

Exceptions are Go (default toolchain works great) and Python (mostly using uv).

My approach is installing LTS versions globally with per-project overrides.

## Beeper

I use Beeper to aggregate all my chat apps, I highly recommend it.
